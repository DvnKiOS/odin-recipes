    <p>
        A small website featuring some of my favorite meals from the Rochester area. 
        I hope visitors will learn as much as I did while creating it. 
        This project is a great addition to any developer's skill set, 
        regardless of their branch in the development world. 
        Thank you for looking at my code, and special thanks to the 
        Odin Project for providing developers with learning resources and a 
        supportive community.
