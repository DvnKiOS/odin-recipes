            Rochester Style wings are a popular variation of
             chicken wings from Rochester, New York. Known for their 
             unique preparation and flavor, these wings are typically 
             marinated in a mixture of spices and then grilled or baked, rather than deep-fried. This method gives them a distinct smoky flavor and a slightly crisp texture.
        </p>

            After cooking, the wings are often tossed in a tangy,
             savory sauce made from a blend of hot sauce, butter, and other seasonings. This gives Rochester Style wings a perfect balance of heat and flavor. They are commonly served with a side of celery and blue cheese dressing, making them a favorite for gatherings and game days.
