        A Garbage Plate is a famous dish from Rochester, New York, known for its hearty and indulgent nature. It typically consists of a base of home fries, macaroni salad, or baked beans, topped with various meats such as cheeseburgers, hot dogs, or sausages. The dish is then smothered in a combination of condiments, including mustard, onions, and a meat-based hot sauce.
