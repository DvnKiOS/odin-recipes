        Description:
       </h2>
    <p>
        A breaded burger, also known as a breaded pork tenderloin sandwich, is a regional specialty from the Midwest, particularly popular in states like Iowa and Indiana. It consists of a tenderized and flattened pork tenderloin that is breaded and fried until crispy and golden brown. The breaded pork is typically served on a bun with traditional toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickles.
    </p>
    <p>
        The breaded burger is known for its large size, often extending well beyond the edges of the bun. It's a hearty and satisfying sandwich that has become a beloved comfort food in its region of origin. Variations may include different breading styles or toppings, but the essence of a breaded burger lies in its crispy exterior and tender, juicy pork inside.
