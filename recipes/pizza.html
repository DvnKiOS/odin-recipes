    Description:
   </h2>
    <p>
        Rochester Style pizza is a unique pizza style originating from Rochester, New York. It is characterized by a thick, airy crust that is more similar to focaccia bread than traditional pizza dough. The crust is typically brushed with garlic-infused olive oil and topped with a generous amount of mozzarella cheese.
    </p>

        One of the defining features of Rochester Style pizza is the "cup and char" pepperoni. This type of pepperoni curls up into crispy cups when cooked, creating small pools of flavorful grease ("char") on top of the pizza. This adds a distinctive texture and taste that is beloved by fans of this style.
    </p>

        The pizza is often cut into squares or "slabs," rather than traditional triangular slices, making it easy to share and enjoy. Rochester Style pizza is a local favorite and can be found in pizzerias throughout the Rochester area, offering a unique twist on traditional pizza that continues to delight pizza enthusiasts.
